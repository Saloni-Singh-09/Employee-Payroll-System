# Employee Payroll Management System

A Python-based application developed to manage employee records and automate salary calculations. This project focuses on organized code structure using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and persistent data storage.

## Core Functionalities
- Employee Management: Interface to add and store employee details like ID and Name.
- Salary Calculation: Automated logic to calculate Gross Salary including HRA components.
- Data Persistence: All records are saved in a local text database (employees.txt) to ensure information is not lost after closing the program.
- Payroll Reporting: Generates monthly pay slips with a clear breakdown of earnings.
- Operations: The system currently handles 4 main operations: Adding Employees, Viewing Records, Processing Payroll, and Exit/Data Export.

## Technical Details
- Programming Language: Python 3
- Data Handling: File Input/Output (I/O)
- Architecture: Modular design with dedicated classes for Employee and Payroll management.
